# Lightship Submission Helper

This plugin allows users to export Lightship (Niantic Spatial) submission data and integrate it with the [Wayfarer Planner](https://gitlab.com/NvlblNm/wayfarer) for better visualization and planning on the map.

After setting up the corresponding Wayfarer Planner web app, simply import its URL into lightship-exporter.
